// General notes about DS:

// dS are ollections of values, relationships amongst them, and the fxns or operations that can be applied to the data
// adding, removing, push, pop
// some ds are hihgly specialized, while others like arrays are more generally used
// they all do the same thing: Storing data. But how you treat and act upon them is very different.
// As you get more sophisiticated in your tasks, simple arrays and objects just don't cut it anymore.
