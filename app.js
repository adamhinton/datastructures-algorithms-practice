// SINGLY LINKED LISTS
// We will be building our own SLL from scratch. Yay!

// What is a linked list?
// ordered DS that stores any value you want
// in array, each is mapped with a number. But in a LL, there are nodes, and each node has a value, and a pointer to another node or null
// So, no indexes
// We call each element a node
// its pointer points to another node
// Head is first, tail is the end.
// also keep track of length of LL
