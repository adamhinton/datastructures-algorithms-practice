// SINGLY LINKED LISTS
// We will be building our own SLL from scratch. Yay!

// What is a linked list?
// ordered DS that stores any value you want
// in array, each is mapped with a number. But in a LL, there are nodes, and each node has a value, and a pointer to another node or null
// So, no indexes
// We call each element a node
// its pointer points to another node
// Head is first, tail is the end.
// also keep track of length of LL

// Basically it's just a bunch of nodes pointing to the next node.

// searching/inserting in middle frex is O(n)
// inserting at beginning or end is O(1)

// Comparisons with array:

// LISTS:
// no indexes
//connected via nodes with a "next" pointer
// Random access not allowed

// ARRAYS:
// Indexed in order
// insertion and deletion can be expensive
// can quickly be accessed at a specific index

// LLs are really good at insertion and deletion. Esp since in arrays, inserting at beginning can run in to nasty time complexity.
