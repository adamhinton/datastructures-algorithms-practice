// General notes about DS:

// dS are ollections of values, relationships amongst them, and the fxns or operations that can be applied to the data
// adding, removing, push, pop
// some ds are hihgly specialized, while others like arrays are more generally used
// they all do the same thing: Storing data. But how you treat and act upon them is very different.
// As you get more sophisiticated in your tasks, simple arrays and objects just don't cut it anymore.
// You've worked with many unknowingly, like hash tables or the DOM which involves interacting with a tree.
// These are the fodder of many an interview.
// There's no one best DS
// Don't get overwhelmed trying to master it all at once.
// There is a LOT to this. You'll get burned out if you go too fast.
